# Chatbot v2 design

Status: in progress. Assumes a new deployment with one backend and hundreds of users
at most, so no scaling work is planned.

## Scope

**In scope**

- Mistral for chat and embeddings, with a model fallback
- Hardened authentication
- Mobile navbar fix and consistent shadcn styling, including the admin side
- Generated frontend types from the backend's OpenAPI schema
- Agent loop with tool calls instead of a one-shot classifier
- Web search through Exa, behind a provider interface
- AI Elements UI: inline citations, tool steps, suggested questions

**Out of scope**

- Reasoning output. Ministral rejects `reasoning_effort` with a 400, and Small 4 and
  Medium 3.5 returned 429 on this key.
- Migrating old data. This is a new deployment.

## Models

| Purpose | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Chat (main) | `ministral-14b-latest` | 262,144 token context |
| Chat (fallback) | `ministral-8b-latest` | Used on 429, 5xx and connection failures, before the first token only |
| Embeddings | `mistral-embed` | 1024 dimensions, Pinecone index `documents-mistral-embed` |

Observed limits on the test key: 30 requests per minute and 937,500 tokens per minute,
so requests run out first. Token counts stay as `tiktoken` estimates with a safety
margin. `mistral-common`'s `from_model` rejected all five current model names tried.

Embeddings have no runtime fallback, because vectors from different models are not
comparable. Changing the model means a new index and re-embedding every document.

## Authentication

- Access token: 15 minutes, kept in memory only, carries a `sid` claim that is checked
  against the session row on each request, so logout takes effect immediately.
- Refresh token: HttpOnly cookie scoped to `/auth`, rotated on each use. The session row
  keeps a stable ID across rotations.
- Reuse handling: the previous token within the grace period returns 409 and the client
  retries, because this is normally two tabs racing. Any other stale token revokes the
  session.
- Sessions end after 7 days idle or 30 days in total.
- Login attempts are limited in Redis per account, and per IP when
  `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true`. Redis failures do not block login.
- Tabs serialize refreshes with `navigator.locks`.

## Stream protocol (planned)

Typed SSE events: `text-delta`, `tool-start`, `tool-result`, `sources`, `suggestions`,
`done`, `error`. Messages gain a `parts` JSONB column, because sources are not saved
today and citations would disappear on reload.

## Agent (planned)

```
agent (LLM + tools) ──tool calls──> run tools ──> back to agent
        └── no tool calls ──> final answer ──> suggestions ──> persist
```

- Tools: `search_documents` (only when documents exist), `get_weather`, `report_bug`,
  `web_search`.
- The loop is capped at about 4 steps, then forced to answer with `tool_choice="none"`.
- `SearchProvider` interface with `ExaSearchProvider`, selected by `SEARCH_PROVIDER`.
- Web pages are untrusted input. Disable `report_bug` after a web search, limit query
  length, set per-user quotas, allow only `http` and `https` citation links, and leave
  out a `fetch_url` tool.

## Frontend

- Own `useChat` and SSE stream, no AI SDK. AI Elements are copied in and adapted.
- Types generated with `openapi-typescript` into `types/api.ts`. A shared folder does not
  work, because Python cannot import TypeScript and the frontend's Docker build context
  is `frontend/Chatbot`.
- Route groups `(marketing)`, `(auth)` and `(app)`, with no larger reorganization.

## Decisions

| Decision | Solves | Worsens | Change it when… |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sid` check against Postgres | Immediate logout | One more lookup per request | Auth queries become a top latency cost |
| Access token in memory | XSS can't read it from storage | One refresh per page load | Refresh volume becomes a measurable cost |
| Per-account login limit | Password guessing | An attacker can lock an account for 15 minutes | Lockouts are reported by real users |
| Agent loop replaces classifier | Misrouting; multi-step answers | 2–3 LLM calls per turn | Cost per turn exceeds budget |
| Own web search tool | Works with any LLM; own citations | Another vendor and key | Upkeep exceeds Mistral connector fees |
| Same-provider fallback | Per-model limits and capacity errors | No cover for a Mistral outage | A Mistral outage causes real downtime |
| Own SSE events, no AI SDK | Keeps the working stream and LangGraph | Protocol maintained in-house | Several AI SDK features would need rebuilding |
| Generated types | Stops frontend and backend drifting | One generation step | A second client needs the same API |

## Build order

1. Auth fixes and navbar
2. shadcn cleanup, folder changes, generated types
3. Stream events and `parts` storage, keeping today's graph
4. Agent loop with the existing tools
5. Web search and inline citations
6. Suggested questions

## Weakest points

- **Tool permissions:** web content can steer a model that also has private documents and
  a ticket-creating tool. New tools with side effects should need human approval, as
  `report_bug` already does through the admin queue.
- **Shared request budget:** if chat and embeddings share a limit, a large upload can
  block chat. The next move is a paid tier or a shared limiter in Redis.
